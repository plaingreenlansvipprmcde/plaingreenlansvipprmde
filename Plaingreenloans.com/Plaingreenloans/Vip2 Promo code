A new law that has been written into the books this year may interfere with the ability of many to get emergency funds by limiting access to payday loans across the state of Washington. The law which officially took effect January 1, 2010, has already received some seriously mixed reviews from both sides of the debate. Many are wondering whether the new legislation, which drastically affects the payday loans industry in the state, will be helpful or if it will be a hindrance for both the borrowers and lenders who rely on such services on a regular basis.

Legislation began as a result of years of bitter fighting between the payday loans industry and consumer advocate groups who were concerned about the potential risk for abuse and dependency from borrowers and loaners alike. The main idea is to set strict limits on what consumers can borrow and provide them with more payment options. The objective of the new law is to encourage borrowers to step up and take more responsibility for their monthly budget and get their debt under control. What lawmakers fail to take into account is that many consumers honestly need the money and feel the sting of the recent legislation. Lawmakers shouldn't have the right to tell people how they spend their own money. It isn't the government's place to baby sit people after all.
