PayDay Loans are now offered by thousands of companies, which can make it quite a challenge to know how to begin choosing between them. It is important to understand that there are lots of differences between these companies, and that knowing how to narrow down your search to the best lenders can make a big difference. Not all organisations that present themselves as providers of payday loans are actually direct lenders themselves. Many of them will pass your application on to one or more other companies. By going straight to a direct lender you can usually get a faster service and a better deal.

PayDay Loans are always for only a short period of time, so getting the money quickly can make all the difference. A good direct lender will be able to put money straight into your bank on the same day as you apply for a loan, often in as little as an hour. Payday loan providers who have to pass your application on to other lenders will inevitably have longer processes, and are unlikely to be able to guarantee a time frame for getting your money to you, as this will vary depending on which lender ends up actually providing the loan. As there is an extra party to be paid in such transactions, you can end up paying more for a loan through a broker. For this reason you tend to get a better deal by going to a direct lender.
