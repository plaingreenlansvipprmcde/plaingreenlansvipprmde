There are many online payday loan companies which claim to offer instant no fax cash loans with little or no credit required. There are pro's and con's to the borrowing money this way. This article is about things to remember and realize when you apply for or receive a cash advance loan.

First things first. To define what a payday advance loan really is, lets look in to how they work.

A payday is basically the same as you taking a post dated check to pawn shop. The down side to this is the interest you are going to pay on the money that you borrow. Things to remember when you get or apply for payday or cash advance loans:

#1. You are going to have to pay the loan back. I mean come one, this is a gimme.

#2. You are going to pay them back more money than you borrowed. Fees vary from lender to lender and from state to state.
